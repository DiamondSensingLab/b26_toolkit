        Creates a pulse sequence with no pulses for a reset time, then the laser on for a count_source_pulse_width time.
        The daq measurement window is then swept across the laser pulse window to measure counts from min_delay
        (can be negative) to max_delay, which are both defined with the laser on at 0.

        Returns: pulse_sequences, num_averages, tau_list, measurement_gate_width
            pulse_sequences: a list of pulse sequences, each corresponding to a different time 'tau' that is to be
            scanned over. Each pulse sequence is a list of pulse objects containing the desired pulses. Each pulse
            sequence must have the same number of daq read pulses
            num_averages: the number of times to repeat each pulse sequence
            tau_list: the list of times tau, with each value corresponding to a pulse sequence in pulse_sequences
            measurement_gate_width: the width (in ns) of the daq measurement
